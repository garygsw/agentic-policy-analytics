# Decision log

Each entry records the date, the decision, the alternatives considered and the reasoning. Entries marked **Open** are waiting on a decision.

## D-001 · 2026-10-14 · Secrets and local files stay out of the repo
- **Decision:** API keys live only in `.env` (gitignored). They are set with `scripts/set_keys.py`, which hides input, never prints a key, writes the file with owner-only permissions, and refuses to write if git would not ignore the file. Assistant instruction files and local tool configuration are gitignored too, and a local pre-commit check blocks them and anything that looks like an API key.
- **Alternatives:** Exporting keys in the shell profile. A secrets manager, which is the production path (see ARCHITECTURE.md) but overkill for local development.
- **Why:** The repository is public.

## D-002 · 2026-10-14 · LLM providers: OpenAI primary, Anthropic fallback
- **Decision:** OpenAI is the primary provider and Anthropic the automatic fallback, behind one interface. A `FakeLLM` serves tests, and a flag forces a primary failure for demos.
- **Alternatives:** Adding Gemini as a third provider. Claude through AWS Bedrock.
- **Why:** These are the keys available. The brief lists AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, GCP Gemini and Azure OpenAI. The direct Anthropic API is a deliberate deviation: it serves the same model family as Claude on Bedrock, and the provider interface keeps a Bedrock adapter a small addition.

## D-003 · 2026-10-14 · ReAct step format: JSON validated by pydantic
- **Decision:** Every agent step is a JSON object `{thought, action, args}`, validated against a pydantic model. Malformed output gets one retry that includes the validation error.
- **Alternatives:** Each provider's native tool calling.
- **Why:** One format works for both providers and the FakeLLM, and the reasoning is explicit and can be streamed to the UI as it happens.

## D-004 · 2026-10-14 · The Coordinator is itself a ReAct agent
- **Decision:** The Coordinator chooses among `delegate_extraction`, `delegate_analytics`, `ask_clarification`, `replan` and `finish`, under a step limit.
- **Alternatives:** A fixed plan run by a deterministic executor, with the LLM called again only to replan after a failure.
- **Why:** The decisions (what to fetch, when to ask, when to replan) are made by the agent and visible in its trace.

## D-005 · 2026-10-14 · Structured data: snapshots, a mock internal API, and one live API with cached fallback
- **Decision:** Committed CSV and Excel snapshots of official statistics, a mock JSON API for "internal" data, and one live public API that falls back to its snapshot when it fails.
- **Alternatives:** Snapshots only, which leaves no real API failure to demonstrate.
- **Note:** Each dataset's licence is checked and recorded in DATA_SOURCES.md before its snapshot is committed.

## D-006 · 2026-10-14 · Unstructured context through RAG
- **Decision:** Policy documents, news and press releases, public statements and parliamentary transcripts are ingested by a scheduled pipeline. Each source type has its own chunking strategy, and an embedding model is used at both ingestion and query time. Retrieval is hybrid (vector plus BM25 keyword) with reranking, and it is exposed to the agents as a search tool. Every retrieved passage carries citation metadata into the report.
- **Open:** Which sources come first, the store, the embedding model, the reranker and the scheduler.

## D-007 · 2026-10-14 · HTML reports, with charts made by an agent tool
- **Decision:** The final report is a self-contained HTML document in a clean, minimal reading style. Agents create charts through a chart tool.
- **Open:** Whether the LLM writes HTML directly, or writes a structured report that a template renders.

## D-008 · Open · Agent harness: custom ReAct loop or LangGraph
